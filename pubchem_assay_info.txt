1	-	-	-	DTP/NCI	NCI human tumor cell line growth inhibition assay. Data for the NCI-H23 Non-Small Cell Lung cell line	Growth inhibition of the NCI-H23 human Non-Small Cell Lung tumor cell line is measured as a screen for anti-cancer activity. Cells are grown in 96 well plates and exposed to the test compound for 48 hours. Compounds are tested at 5 different concentrations and three endpoints are estimated from this dose response curve: GI50, concentration required for 50% inhibition of growth, TGI, the concentration requires for complete inhibition of growth, and LC50, the concentration required for 50% reduction in cell number. These estimates are done by simple linear interpolation between the concentrations that surround the approriate level. If a compound doesn&apos;t cause inhibition to the appropriate level, the endpoint is set to the highest concentration tested. 	Basically compounds  with LogGI50 (unit M) less than -6 were considered as active. Activity score was based on increasing values of -LogGI50.	confirmatory	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/1
1000	4442084	373153	-	SRMLSC	Screening for Inhibitors of the Mevalonate Pathway in Streptococcus Pneumoniae - MK Secondary Assay	A total of 57 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 100 uM. Compounds with more than 20% inhibition at 100 uM were then tested in dose response assays at seven concentrations, ranging from 100 uM to 0.0156 uM depending on the % inhibition for each compound in the initial 100 uM screen. To confirm that the compounds were specifically inhibiting MK and not one of the other enzymes in the assay, the compounds were tested in parallel in an assay that contained hexokinase as the enzyme instead of MK and glucose as the substrate instead of mevalonate.  None of the compounds tested inhibited in this &apos;coupling enzymes&apos; assay.	In this confirmatory dose response screen active compounds were scored on a scale of 41-80 using an inverted linear correlation to EC50s between 0 and 40 uM. Compounds that did not confirm as actives in the dose response screen were given the score 0. 	confirmatory	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/1000

The spacing and metal-chelating residues (3 Cys, 1 His) of the Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys Zn fingers are conserved among all known retroviruses (J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 1371-1381). HIV-1 NC was assayed for its binding to the consensus sequence single-stranded 5&apos;-TGTGTGTG. The assay utilizes fluorescence polarization (FP) where probe TGx4F (fluorescein-labeled 5&apos;-TGTGTGTG) exhibiting low polarization is mixed with HIV-1 NC. The protein-probe complex exhibited high polarization, whereas inhibitors of that binding led to a drop in the FP value. High salt was included to increase the stringency of binding and inhibitor screen. Reducing agents and zinc were present to stabilize the nucleocapsid zinc-finger protein. 	Recombinant HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein and labeled probe were supplied by Dr. Robert Schoemaker, NCI-Frederick.	confirmatory	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/346

The Km for the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside and Fluorescein di-beta-D-Glucopyranoside were determined to be 71.2 uM and 855 uM, respectively. The IC50 values of Conduritol B Epoxide, a known glucocerebrosidase inhibitor, were determined to be 87.5 uM and 117 uM, respectively. The use of two difference pro-fluorescent substrates in the screens helped to eliminate false positives. All compounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s).

The cellular phosphotransfer becomes particularly important during in tissues with an increase energy demand. Like it has been shown that in heart failure AK1 expression levels correlate well with functional recovery in the metabolically compromised heart. Isoforms of adenylate kinase are found in mitochondria, cytosol, and cellular membranes, creating an integrated phosphotransfer network. An intimate relationship of adenylate kinase with mitochondrial respiration, myofibrillar and membrane ATPases, as well as metabolic sensors such as ATP-sensitive K+ channels, contributes to efficient regulation of energy metabolism, membrane excitability, and cell contraction.

PAK kinases contain a well defined p21-binding domain (PBD) including the CRIB motif. Six members of this kinase family have been identified in human. The PAK kinase family is subdivided into two groups according to kinase domain homology and the existence of a conserved autoinhibitory domain (AID). Group I PAKs (PAKs 1, 2, and 3) exhibit 80 to 90% sequence identity within their catalytic domains and contain a AID domain, whereas the recently identified group II PAKs (PAK 4, 5, and 6), share only about 40 to 50% identity to group I kinase domains and do not contain obvious AID domains. Thus, the mechanisms that regulate group II PAKs are unclear, but the absence of a conserved AID indicates that the modes of regulation differ significantly from group I PAKs.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/390
391	56924	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human PAK6	Six members of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family of protein kinases have been identified to date. PAK&apos;s are serine/threonine kinases and can be classified into two groups named group I (PAK 1-3), and group II (PAK 4-6) based on their sequence homology and regulatory properties. In addition to the C-terminal Ste20-like catalytic domain, PAK kinases contain a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) domain. PAK family members have been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular functions, including actin reorganization, apoptotic signaling, cell motility, gene transcription, cell transformation and steroid hormone receptor signalling. Recently it has been demonstrated that basal PAK6 kinase activity is repressed by a p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase antagonist and can be stimulated by constitutively active MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6), an activator of p38 MAP kinases as well as by p38 MAP kinase itsself . PAK6 is directly activated by MKK6 on the activation loop residue Tyr566 once the auto-phosphorylation site Ser560 is phosphorylated. The activation of PAK6 by MKK6 and p38 suggests that PAK6 plays a role in the cellular response to stress-related signals.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/391

The protein is ubiquitously expressed with particular high expression in liver, kidney and thymus. Expression of STK16 is enhanced by TGF beta. Over-expression of STK16 leads to disorganization of the Golgi apparatus into vesicular structures, suggesting that STK16 is involved in the secretory pathway.

400	84867	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Activity Assay, Human PTPN5	STEP, a striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase, is preferentially expressed in neurons of the basal ganglia, hippocampus, cortex and related structures. Alternative splicing produces various STEP family members, and both cytosolic (STEP 46) and membrane-associated (STEP 61) variants exist. STEP and its non-neuronal homologs like He-PTP have been implicated in the regulation of ERK activity. Both splice products STEP 61 and STEP 46 are phosphorylated in a common kinase-interacting domain (KIM) that binds to ERK2. The kinase PKA phosphorylates STEP 46 at Ser49 (equivalent to Ser221 in STEP 61) which decreases the activity of STEP by reducing its affinity for its substrates. Dephosphorylated STEP binds and inactivates ERK through dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in its activation domain and blocks nuclear translocation of the kinase. These findings establish STEP as an important tyrosine phosphatase involved in regulating the duration of ERK signaling in neurons. 	-	-	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/400

It is preferentially expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells, particularly B and T lymphocytes, and is an early response gene in lymphokine stimulated cells. PTPN7 belongs to a subgroup of PTPs with two other members (PTPN5 and PTPRR) which have a non-catalytic N-terminal kinase interaction motif (KIM). These phosphatases interact with and negatively regulate mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38 by dephosphorylation of the critical phospho-tyrosine in the activation loop of ERK. It has been suggested that PTPN7 plays a negative role in T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling by down regulating MAP kinases activity in the cytosol at early time points of T cell activation. This data have been confirmed by PTPN7#/# mice which show an elevated activation of Erk signalling after exposure to protein kinase C activator (PMA) and TCR stimulation. Amplification and overexpression of PTPN7 has been suggested to be an important cofactor contributing to abnormal myeloid cell growth. In addition, PTPN7 gene maps to region 1q32.1 where chromosomal deletions are observed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We determined the structure of PTPN7 phosphatase domain which contains also part of the N-terminal kinase interaction motif at 2.6A resolution.	-	confirmatory	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/401
402	5784	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Activity Assay, Human PTPN14	PTPN14 (Pez) is a member of the cytoplamic FERM-domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family which are characterized by a FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domains at their N-termini, and PTP (protein tyrosine phosphatase) domains at their C-termini. PTPN14 was first cloned in a screen for PTPs expressed in normal breast tissue. It is also expressed in varying amounts in other tissues including kidney, skeletal muscle, lung and placenta. In addition, PTPN14 is highly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), suggesting it may be a critical enzyme in regulating endothelial cell function.	-	-	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/402
403	5795	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Activity Assay, Human PTPRJ	PTPRJ is a member of the R3 family of protein tyrosine phosphatases. It possesses an extracellular region containing fibronectin type III repeats, a single transmembrane region, and a single intracytoplasmic catalytic domain. PTPRJ is expressed in all hematopoietic lineages in particular in granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Weaker expression levels have been described for peripheral blood lymphocytes, including CD4 and CD8-positive T-cell subsets, B cells- in particular memory B cells- platelets, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cell types and transformed lymphoid T- and B cell lines. Among non-lymphoid tissues PTPRJ is found on the epithelium of the small and large bowel mucosa, appendix, endometrium, fallopian tubes, mammary glands, prostate glands, pancreatic acini and ducts, glandula parotis, cutaneous sweat glands and proximal and distal tubules of the kidney, fibrocytes, melanocytes and Schwann cells. It is also expressed at high levels in endothelia, including developing renal vascular endothelia. PTPRJ expression is up-regulated in leukocytes present in inflamed tissues as well as after in vitro activation with stimuli such as Con A, PMA or LPS. CSF-1 (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) leads to down-regulation of expression levels.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/403
404	5796	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Activity Assay, Human PTPRK	PTPRK belongs together with PTPRM, PTPRT and PTPRU to the R2A/IIb subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPRK possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem catalytic domains. The extracellular region contains a meprin-A5 antigen-PTP mu (MAM) domain, an Ig-like domain and four fibronectin type III-like repeats. The purified extracellular domain of PTPRK functions as a substrate for adhesion by cells expressing PTPRK and induces aggregation of coated synthetic beads.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/404
405	5801	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Activity Assay, Human PTPRR	The tyrosine receptor phosphatase PTPRR is composed of an extra cellular region, a single transmembrane region, and a single intracellular catalytic domain which classifies this phosphatase as a receptor class 7 family member. The mouse homologue (PTPR-SL) is predominately expressed in brain and was shown to regulate activity and cellular localization of MAP kinases. A 16 amino acid kinase interaction motif (KIM domain) is critical for binding to MAP kinases. PTPRR was shown to potently reduce ERK5 kinase activity and interferes with the translocation of ERK5 into the nucleus. PTPRR is also a substrate of ERK5. Phosphorylation by ERK5 reduces affinity of PTPRR for the kinases but leaves the phosphatase activity unaffected. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates PTPRR on a serine residue located in the KIM domain which impairs binding and dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38. The rat counterpart PTPBR7 (corresponding to the human alpha form) is regulated by the nerve growth factor, which suggests a function of this gene in neuronal growth and differentiation.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/405

NFAT plays the immunomodulatory role, primarily in T-cell activation and differentiation. NFAT target genes are also involved in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation in non-immune cell types. The NFAT sequence was engineered to the upstream of the ?-lactamase reporter gene and transfected into Jurkat cells with co-transfection of muscarinic receptor1 [provided by Invitrogen Corp]. When an extracellular stimulus, such as carbachol, binds to the GPCR M1 receptor, it stimulates a signaling cascade that activates NFAT response element and ?-lactamase expression by phosphorylating the NFAT binding protein. This cell based ?-lactamase reporter gene assay can accurately monitor any changes occurring along the NFAT pathway, and can be used for screening small molecule inhibitor or activator upon activation by carbachol EC50 concentration.

The assay uses green (CBG68) and red (CBR) emitting beetle luciferases [Chroma-Glo(TM) developed by Promega Corp.] where the green luciferase is fused to I-kappa-B-alpha  and the red luciferase is present in its native state. Both luciferase genes are stably present in the OCI-Ly3 human ABC DLBCL cell line, but their expression is under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoters. Following the addition of doxycycline to induce expression of the luciferases, the green luminescence in control cultures rises only slowly because the CBG fusion partner I-kappa-B-alpha is targeted by IKK activity for rapid degradation. In contrast, green luminescence rises rapidly in the presence of proteasome inhibitors or IKK inhibitors. The rise in red luminescence of CBR is not affected by proteasome or IKK inhibitors, and serves as normalization for cell number and nonspecific effects. Compounds were screened as a concentration-titration series that ranged from 57 uM to 0.7 nM.	2.

This type of glycosylation is involved in signal transduction and plays a key role in many essential cellular processes. High O-GlcNAc levels have been correlated to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In addition to elucidating the role of O-GlcNAc in cellular processes, inhibitors of OGT might be useful in studying and perhaps treating type 2 diabetes. Since HTS-amenable direct assay for OGT activity is currently unavailable, a simpler substrate-displacement screen was performed. The signal measured is based on the change in fluorescence polarization of a fluorescein-labeled UDP-GlcNAc upon displacement from its complex with OGT. Recombinant truncated version of the enzyme, sOGT, as well as labeled probe, were made available by Suzanne Walker and Benjamin Gross, Harvard Medical School.	2.

448	-	6183	-	NCGC	Schistosoma Mansoni Peroxiredoxins (Prx2)	Schistosoma mansoni, a causative agent of schistosomiasis, resides in the bloodstream of their host up to 30 years without being eliminated by the host immune attack. One proposed survival mechanism is the production of an antioxidant &quot;firewall&quot; that neutralizes the oxidative assault of the host&apos;s immune attack. Schistosoma mansoni peroxiredoxins (Prx) are important parasite antioxidant proteins that play a crucial role in redox balance mechanisms. Data strongly suggest the possible use of Prx as novel drug targets. First, the proteins are essential for the parasite survival. Second, the proteins exhibit sufficient biochemical and structural differences from host Prx proteins. Third, the protein(s) is amenable for study at the molecular level and can be produced in bacteria in large quantities, in soluble and active form. Inhibition of Prx activity was screened in a coupled-enzyme format with reducing equivalents being transferred from NADPH to glutathione intermediate via thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TGR)-catalyzed reaction, then from thioredoxin to hydrogen peroxide via Prx-catalyzed electron transfer. A decrease in the fluorescence intensity of NADPH was used to measure the enzyme activity. Purified S. mansoni TGR and Prx were provided by Professor David L. Williams, Illinois State University.	2.

450	2908	9606	-	NCGC	GR-GFP Redistribution	The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) Redistribution assay (BioImage) enables the visualization of GR cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation by the use of a GR-GFP fusion.  GR is normally cytosolic, however ligands such as dexamethasone, cause nuclear translocation where the protein binds to response elements and interacts with various co-factors to modulate transcription.  Because both functional agonists and antagonists can induce nuclear translocation, this assay can detect ligands regardless of their effects on gene expression. GR-GFP expressing U20S cells were used here. Dexamethasone was the positive control for translocation and data normalization.  Detection of nuclear translocation was performed in 1536-well plates using the Acumen laser scanning plate cytometer [1] (TTP LabTech). Validation of this assay and a detailed protocol have been described [2].	2. Within each curve class, compounds are ranked by potency	confirmatory	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/450
451	2908	9606	-	NCGC	GR-EFC Redistribution	Immunocytochemical staining has been used to assay for GR translocation, but is not suitable for high throughout screening due to the multiple reagent addition and wash steps required. Recently, a novel cell-based GR assay in Enzyme Fragment Complementation (EFC) format was developed by DiscoveRx (Fremont, CA).  The assay uses EFC of b-galactosidase (b-gal) as an indicator of GR-translocation in engineered CHO-K1 biosensor cells. The enzyme acceptor (EA) fragment of b-gal resides in the nucleus , as designed through the use of a proprietary set of sequence additions and modifications. The small peptide enzyme donor (ED) fragment of b-gal is fused directly to the C-terminus of GR, and is localized in the cytoplasm is the absence of receptor signaling. Upon binding to a GR ligand, the complex translocates to the nucleus, where intact enzyme activity is restored by complementation and b-gal activity is detected. We optimized this GR-EFC assay in homogenous 1536-well plate assay format for high throughput screening.	2.

473	-	-	-	Diabetic Complications Screening	An ELISA method to detect accelerated cleavage of Integrin Associated Protein	Glucose concentrations of 12mM or greater are required to protect IAP from proteolytic cleavage. IAP that is protected from cleavage allows the tyrosine phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein, SHPS-1, in response to IGF-I. Phosphorylation of SHPS-1 is required for the activation of c-Src kinase which in turn is required for the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc. Recruitment of Shc to SHPS-1 and its subsequent phosphorylation are required for activation of the MAPK pathway in response to IGF-I. This in turn is required for IGF-I to stimulate an increase in cell proliferation. Therefore compounds that accelerate the cleavage of IAP function to inhibit the ability of IGF-I to stimulate cell proliferation in high glucose conditions.	The optical density (OD) as a measure of antibody binding to cells in 25 mM glucose (hi Control) is subtracted from the OD reading for cells grown in 5mM (normal) glucose.  This is defined as deltaODmax .  The OD reading for hi Control is then subtracted from OD for each test compound (deltaODtest). A percent value is calculated for each compound by the equation deltaODtest/delatODmax) x 100.

We have already established that 15 mM glucose reduces cell viability by 75% under these conditions compared with 5 mM glucose, whereas without the presence of H202, neither 15 mM nor 5 mM glucose reduce viability.	The score reflects the % viable cells at 15 mM glucose in the presence of the drug, relative to % viable cells at 5 mM without the drug which is set at 100% viability. DMSO vehicle only had no effect on this parameter, so without drug the score would be about 15%, reflecting an 85% toxicity of 15 mM glucose in this assay.

This assay has been modified to incorporate hyperglycemic injury (presence of 25 mM glucose) that causes endothelial cells to lose their ability to differentiate as they undergo apoptosis.  The goal of this screen is to test compounds that protect cells from hyperglycemic injury and promote endothelial cell differentiation. The assay uses in-house developed software to measure total vessel length, which is summed length of all endothelial sprouts, obtained from digital images of spheroids captured on an inverted microscope using a 10X objective.  We define this measurement as the sprouting index.	For each drug tested at the concentration of 5 micromolar, an average of 4 spheroids are visually scored for their extent of sprouting. A visual score of 0 is provided when sprouting is inhibited maximally, a score of 50 for non-interfering compounds and a score of 100 for those that maximally stimulate sprouting. The vast majority of compounds do not interfere with basal sprouting (94%). Two investigators independently score the primary screen and their average findings determine the selection of compounds that score above 50.  Compounds that scored 80 and above were selected for dose-dependent effects. In this second round of screening, a computer software program (developed by Daniel Lau, University of Kentucky) was employed to quantify the total length of all sprouts. We define the sprouting index for each spheroid as the total length of its sprouts in arbitrary units. 	other	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/477

The BODIPY C-16-CoA is known to bind to PPARalpha with high affinity, and is displaced from the PPARalpha ligand binding pocket by glucose binding.	The percent change in fluorescent fatty acyl-CoA binding was calculated for each substance (as compared to controls), and these values were multiplied by 10 to fit the 0-100 scale.  In order to score substances on a linear scale, any substance that resulted in a negative change (decreased fatty acyl-CoA binding even more than glucose alone) were considered to have no activity (score = 0). 	other	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/479

502	-	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human AKR7A3	Aflatoxin B1 is one of the most potent hepatocarcinogens known, and occurs as a toxic metabolite produced under conditions of high heat and humidity by fungal molds of the genus Aspergillus, growing on agricultural crops such as peanuts or corn. The combined effects of this reactive fungal metabolite and the high occurrence of hepatitis virus infection lead to the extremely elevated incidence of hepatocellular cancer especially in Asia and Africa.                The carcinogenic effects are due to bioactivation to highly reactive species and ultimately lead to DNA adducts and lesions. In humans, competing inactivating pathways include reduction of an intermediate Aflatoxin dialdehyde to the dialcohol product by human aldo-keto reductases. Several members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family, specifically members of the AKR7 subfamily, are involved in the detoxification and metabolism of a variety of exogenous aldehydes and ketones, such as aflatoxin dialdehyde. The human isozymes AKR7A3 and AKR7A2 share 88% sequence identities, and catalyze the NADPH-dependent inactivation of aflatoxin dialdehyde. AKR enzymes share a common (alpha/beta)8 barrel folding pattern with a tetrad of conserved active site residues. The structure determined of AKR7A3 (3.0A resolution) is compatible with the known stereochemistry of aflatoxin dialdehyde conversion.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/502
503	64407	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human RGS18	Regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) proteins contain domains that terminate the signal emanating from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). When a GPCR binds a specific ligand, a signal is generated that is transmitted to the G-proteins that consist of Galpha and Gbeta-gamma subunits. In the inactive state, Galpha and Gbeta-gamma exist as a complex with the Galpha GTPase in the inactive GDP bound form. Upon activation, GDP is replaced with GTP which induces Galpha; and Gbeta-gamma complex disassociation. At this stage both Galpha and Gbeta-gamma proteins are active. Galpha does have an intrinsic GTPase activity but this is greatly enhanced by the association with an RGS domain. Hence RGS proteins act as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Once GTP hydrolysis has taken place the GDP-Galpha protein can recombine with Gbeta-gamma thus terminating the signal. RGS18 is a member of the B/R4 subfamily of RGS proteins. All of these subfamily members have an N-terminal amphipathic helix which enhances the localisation of the protein to the membrane surface (Bernstein et al, 2000; Chen et al, 1999) where it is ideally placed to interact with the G-proteins. Its expression is most abundant in platelets and megakaryocytes and it binds to Galpha-i1, Galpha-i2, Galpha-i3, and Galpha-q but not Galpha-z, Galpha-s or Galpha-12 ( Gagnon et al, 2002; Nagata et al, 2001). Although no direct link to any specific disease is yet proven, RGS18 is believed to play roles in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis (Yowe at al 2001), in platelet activation (Gagnon et al 2002), and as an inhibitor for chemokine-induced dendritic cell migration (Shi et al 2004), acting primarily via modulation of Gq signaling (Park et al, 2001). 	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/503
504	5881	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human RAC3	Cells respond in many ways to environmental changes including altering gene expression, physically moving locations, changes to cell-cell interactions, differentiation and even altering their life spans. This is achieved through a signalling network that consists of several signalling pathways. The network receives multiple signals, interprets the signals, amplified and then transmits the signals. One of the best characterised signalling pathways involves the ras GTPase family. The importance of this family of small GTPases to human health was first recognised through the identification of the human H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras genes as being oncogenic. Rac1, Rac2 and Rac3 are a subfamily within the Rho family of small GTPases. Rac1 is expressed in most cell tissues (Moll et al, 1991), Rac2 is specifically expressed in hematopietic cells (Shirat et al, 1990) whereas Rac3 is localised mostly to the adult brain and expression in the developing nervous system (Albertinazzi et al, 1998; Haataja et al, 1997). Rac3 has been shown to activate the JNK/stress activated kinase pathway (Haataja et al, 1997). Up-regulation of this pathway and the p21-activated kinase (for PAK-4 structure see http://www.sgc.ox.ac.uk/structures/PAK4_2bva.html) by activated-GTP bound Rac3 occurs in breast cancer cells (Mira et al, 2000). Moreover, activated Rac3 is involved in the development of leukemia with the Rac3 knockout mice having a longer average survival rate (Cho et al, 2005). Hence, prevention of Rac3 activation by blocking binding of GTP would make Rac3 a potential therapeutic intervention point against certain leukemias and cancers.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/504
505	11040	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human PIM2	The Pim kinase family includes three constitutively active serine/threonine kinases (Pim-1, -2, and -3) that function as important mediators of cytokine signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. Pim-2 plays an important role in tumour progression and is overexpressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Pim-2 prosurvival signaling can protect cancer cells from apotosis and confers resistance to rapamycin. Substrates include the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, which is phosphorylated on serine 112, thus preventing BAD-Bcl-x L interaction and reversing Bad-induced cell death. Pim-2 also phosphorylates SOCS-1 which stabilizes the protein enabling negative feedback of the Jak/STAT pathway. The Pim kinases are distinguished by a unique hinge-region sequence ERPXPX which removes the +3 hydrogen bond donor and provides potential for the design of specific inhibitors. Pim-2 was crystallized with the ruthenium half-sandwich complex (R)- 5  which is a kinetically-inert metal complex based on the inhibitor staurosporine. Such metal complexes extend the small molecule chemical space previously explored by purely organic scaffolds and produces highly potent inhibitors of the Pim kinases.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/505
506	4751	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human NEK2	Nek2 was first identified as a cell cycle mutant (nimA) which arrested in late G2 phase in the multicellular filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans . The protein has later been cloned and identified as a Ser/Thr kinase called NIMA (Never in Mitosis). Surprisingly deletion of NIMA function leads to G2 arrest even in the presence of fully active Cdc2 kinase and mutational analysis subsequently also showed that activation of NIMA is Cdc2 dependent. Nek2, a human NIMA homolog, is a 48-kDa protein with a catalytic kinase domain localized at the N-terminus of the molecule and a regulatory domain at the C-terminus. Two coiled coils regions are present within the regulatory domain. Nek2 regulation involves homodimerization through a leucine zipper coiled-coil motif which probably facilitates autophosphorylation in trans  resulting in enzymatic activation. Autophosphorylation is however not the only mode of kinase activation: A study investigating meiotic progression in mouse spermatocytes showed that the MAPK/p90Rsk2 pathway is required to control Nek2 activation. Nek2 protein level is low in G1 and increases throughout S and G2. The protein is rapidly degraded at the pro-metaphase to metaphase transition of mitosis in an APC/C-Cdc20-dependent manner and with kinetics similar to Cyclin A. Nek2 is a centrosomal protein that upon overexpression causes centrosome splitting, an event that is different from the physiological separation of centrosomes occurring at G2/M. During centrosome splitting mother and daughter centrioles are separated by &gt;2 mm, but this event is not followed by recruitment of motor proteins at centrosomes and assembly of a functional mitotic spindle. Nek2-driven centrosome splitting is likely accomplished through phosphorylation of C-Nap1, a protein interacting with Nek2 and associated with the proximal ends of mother and daughter centrioles. Depletion of Nek2 by RNAi in mouse embryos revealed defects beginning at the second mitotic division. Many blastomeres arrested during M phase with abnormal spindle structures suggesting that Nek2 is essential for embryonic mitosis, especially for proper segregation of chromosomes.  Nek2 is overexpressed in a number of tumour cells including cell lines derived from Ewing &apos;s tumours (a paediatric osteosarcoma), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, cervical and prostate carcinomas, lymphomas and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). In addition there is a correlation of increased Nek2 expression and poor prognosis of the patients. The role of Nek2 in tumour development makes this protein an interesting target for the development of inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.  We determined the structure of Nek2 in complex with the pyrrole-indolinone compound ( 5-[(Z)- (5-Chloro- 2-oxo-1,2- dihydro-3H- indol-3-ylidene) methyl]-N- [2-(diethylamino) ethyl]-2,4- dimethyl-1H- pyrrole-3-carboxamide ). This inhibitor has been described as a cell-permeable compound that acts as a potent and ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase receptor and angiogenic inhibitor that exhibits activity for PDGFRbeta; (IC50 = 3 nM), VEGFR2 (IC50 = 27 nM), FGFR1 (IC50 = 170 nM), and Kit family members (IC50 ~ 10-500 nM) over EGFR (IC50&gt;20 microM). The inhibitor has been reported to display anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in tumor cells and a related compound (SU11248, sunitinib malate) has been recently approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/506

MAT I/ III is a homo-oligomer composed of catalytic alpha1 subunits but the MAT II isozyme is a hetero-oligomer consisting of two catalytic alpha2 subunits and a regulatory beta subunit. The catalytic subunits are essential enzymes that are highly conserved evolutionarily; the beta subunit is present only in mammals and by associating alpha2 with alters its kinetic properties. MAT 2A is induced in the liver during liver regeneration and is up-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/508

Whereas the N-terminal oxidoreductase domain (HSD17B4) oxidizes in an NAD+ dependent reaction steroids and fatty acids, the central domain (amino acids 324#596) catalyzes specifically dehydration of D-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A derivatives. The physiological function of the C-terminal sterol carrier protein domain (SCP2) is unclear at present.  Several clinical mutations of the HSD17B4 gene have been described and lead to D-specific multifunctional protein deficiency. This manifests as severe peroxisomal disorder of a Zellweger-like syndrome, and is characterised by a high plasma concentration of long chain fatty acids and bile acids. These features impair renal functions and neuronal development (neuronal migration defects and degeneration, Stiff man syndrome).	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/509

511	116986	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human CENTG1	The family of small GTPases play major roles in many cellular processes including cytoskeleton regulation, membrane trafficking, signal transduction and nuclear import. They perform these functions by existing in two forms an active (GTP bound) state and an inactive (GDP bound) state. The reversible cycling between these two states is important in the signalling process and is modified by a number of regulatory proteins including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Centaurin gamma 1 (CENTG1) is a multi-domain protein that based on sequence alignments contains both a GTPase domain and a GAP domain. Here we have determined the structure of the GTPase domain of CENTG1. The overall fold resembles that of known GTPase structures. However, in striking contrast to all other structures of small GTPases no nucleotide was present in the potential nucleotide binding site. As it remains unclear to the ability of this domain to hydrolyse GTP it has been labelled a GTPase-like domain.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/511

513	53944	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human CSNK1G1	CK1 represents a unique group of serine/threonine protein kinases ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic organisms. Seven mammalian CK1 isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, delta and epsilon) and various splice variants have been identified to date. CK1 family members contain a highly conserved N-terminal catalytic domain coupled to a variable C-terminal region that ranges in size from 40 to 180 amino acids. Casein kinases have been described to act as monomeric, constitutively active enzymes. In the CK1 family the Asp-Pro-Glu motif of domain VIII, which is common to most Ser/Thr kinases is replaced by Ser-Ile-Asn. CK1-gamma1 is the most abundant serine/threonine kinase in eukaryotic cell extracts. Several splice variants exist from which two splice variants have been described in more detail: CK1-gamma1S encoding 393 amino acids and CK1-gamma1L encoding 422 amino acids. CK1-gamma1L has a characteristic sequence of 50 amino acids at the C-terminal end and this motif was shown to be shared by the CK1-gamma2 and gamma3 from rat and human, suggesting that it is a signature sequence of the gamma-isoforms. CK1-gamma1 is widely expressed with high RNA levels detected in liver, skeletal muscle, heart and kidney. The short splice variant is mainly detected in testis. Mutations and deregulation of CK1 expression and activity has been linked to various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&apos;s and Parkinson&apos;s disease, sleeping disorders and proliferative diseases such as cancer. We determined the structure  of CK1-gamma1 in complex with an inhibitor of the purine class, a potent, cell-permeable, and selective inhibitor of the cell cycle-regulating kinase, Cdc28p (IC50 = 7 microM), and the related Pho85p kinase (IC50 = 2 microM).	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/513

515	4217	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human MAP3K5	Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K5) which plays an essential role in stress and immune response. ASK1 is activated by various stimuli including liposaccharides (LPS), oxidative stress (ROS), ER stress, influx of calcium ions and various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligands. Signalling through the TRAF6-ASK1-p38 pathway has been shown to be essential for inflammatory response upon LPS stimulation. This role has been convincingly demonstrated by ASK1 -/- mice which show no macroscopic or microscopic phenotype but are resistant to LPS induced septic shock. Human ASK1 is a protein of 1374 amino acids with a central serine/threonine kinase domain. Over-expression of wild-type or constitutively active ASK1 results in activation of the kinases MKK3/MKK6 and MKK4/MKK7 and in induction of apoptosis. However, the downstream events of ASK1 are variable depending on the cell types and cellular context and may lead also to cell differentiation, neurite outgrowth and induction of cytokines. In its inactive form ASK1 forms a homo-oligomer through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. An ubiquitously expressed reduction/oxidation (redox) protein thioredoxin binds to the N-terminal of ASK1 and inhibits its activity. Upon oxidative stress stimulation formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge leads to dissociation of that complex and ASK1 subsequent activation. Apart from it role in apoptosis ASK1 is an essential regulator of TLR-4 (Toll like receptor) mediated innate immunity. Furthermore, ASK1 plays also an important role in polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases known to be the cause of at least nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington&apos;s disease (HD), spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and six spinocerebellar ataxias as well as SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease [MJD]). PolyQ fragments accumulate as aggregates in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus and induce stress leading to neuronal cell death. ASK1 is also a potential therapeutic target for malignant fibrous histiocytomas, an particularly malignant form of undifferentiated liposarcomas.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/515
516	644	9606	-	SGCOxCompounds	Compound Screen Assay, Human BLVRA	Biliverdin reductase alpha (BLVRA) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme, and in mammals it is involved in the degradation of heme (Fe-protoporphyrin IX) by catalyzing the NAD(P)(H) dependent reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin. Bilirubin is an important cellular small molecule antioxidans, and serves to inactivate reactive oxygen species produced under conditions of oxidative stress. A catalytic cycle consisting of effective reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin by BLVRA, ensures that this cytoprotectant despite comparably low tissue levels, is available to inactivate lipophilic reactive oxygen species, thus producing biliverdin.	-	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/516

HePTP is a tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells and regulates the MAP kinases Erk and p38. It has been found that HePTP is often dysregualted in the preleukemic disorder myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Small molecule inhibitors of HePTP will be useful as molecular probes for studying the mechanism of signal transduction and MAP kinase regulation, and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.

The assay used an ubiquitin-GFP construct expressed in U2OS cells (BioImage). Under basal conditions little GFP can be detected as it is degraded by the proteasome. However, treatment of the cells with a proteasome inhibitor such as MG-132 results in a rise in GFP levels that can be detected in as little as four hours. We used the Acumen-Explorer laser plate cytometer having a 488 nm laser as an excitation light source to detect the GFP.

When these reporter bacteria are in the early exponential phase of growth before quorum sensing has occurred, they are non-fluorescent. However, incubation with synthetic type 1 AIP induces GFP production and therefore fluorescence over the next 3 hours.  Incubation of the reporter bacteria alone during this time frame is not sufficient to induce fluorescence indicating that minimal endogenous synthesis of AIP occurs under these conditions.  The AIP activity is indicated by the intensity of GFP florescence.	There were a number of wells in which the number of bacteria detected during analysis was less than 25% of the average number detected over all wells of the plate.  This suggested that test compounds in these wells may have been cytotoxic.

565	-	11676	-	University of Pittsburgh Molecular Library Screening Center	HIV-1 RT-RNase H  MLSCN HTS MH077605	The rapid development of HIV-1 resistance to antiretroviral agents is a major clinical problem. This troubling phenomenon has been observed with each class of current clinically used anti-HIV agents. An increasingly serious clinical problem is the emergence of multi-drug resistant variants of HIV-1 that show varying levels of resistance to many of the experimental drugs in the preclinical pipeline, since these analogs are directed at the same viral target as those agents to which the virus has developed resistance. There is therefore an urgent need to identify and validate new viral targets for drug discovery. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase associated ribonuclease H (RT-RNH) is one such target. Very few inhibitors of RT-RNH have been described, and those identified to date lack the drug like characteristics needed for therapeutic utility. One of the problems with RT-RNH as a target for drug discovery has been the lack of a suitable high-throughput screening (HTS) assay. We have developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay readily applicable to 96-well and 384-well microplate formats with robotic manipulation to enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of HIV-1 RT-RNH. The substrate is an 18 nucleotide 3&apos; - fluorescein labeled RNA annealed to a complementary 18 nucleotide 5&apos; - DABCYL modified DNA. The intact duplex has an extremely low background fluorescent signal and provides up to 50-fold fluorescent signal enhancement following hydrolysis. The size and sequence of the duplex are such that RT-RNH cuts the RNA strand four nucleotides from the 3&apos;-end. The labeled tetraribonucleotide readily dissociates from the complementary DNA at ambient temperature with immediate generation of a fluorescent signal. The assay is rapid, inexpensive and robust, providing Z&apos; factors of 0.8 and coefficients of variation of about 5%. The assay requires only two addition steps with no washing and is thus suitable for robotic operation. 	Secondary assays that will be performed after the primary screen will include a 10 point IC50 assay, a fluorescein quenching assay, a cytotoxicity assay and an HIV replication inhibition assay. The fluorescein quenching assay will involve adding 10 uM of compound to 70 nM of fluorescein in assay buffer. Any compound that quenches the signal will be labeled as a false positive. A cytotoxicity assay and  HIV replication inhibition assay will be performed in Dr. Parniak&apos;s laboratory due to laboratory Biosafety level requirements.	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/565

Data for the SNB-78 Central Nervous System cell line	Growth inhibition of the SNB-78 human Central Nervous System tumor cell line is measured as a screen for anti-cancer activity. Cells are grown in 96 well plates and exposed to the test compound for 48 hours. Compounds are tested at 5 different concentrations and three endpoints are estimated from this dose response curve: GI50, concentration required for 50% inhibition of growth, TGI, the concentration requires for complete inhibition of growth, and LC50, the concentration required for 50% reduction in cell number. These estimates are done by simple linear interpolation between the concentrations that surround the approriate level. If a compound doesn&apos;t cause inhibition to the appropriate level, the endpoint is set to the highest concentration tested. 	Basically compounds  with LogGI50 (unit M) less than -6 were considered as active. Activity score was based on increasing values of -LogGI50.	confirmatory	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/57

Following treatment, ATP was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega). The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminesence. Each plate contained 32 replicates of untreated cells which served as a negative control. Average growth inhibition values were calculated based on two separate experiments. Compounds that reduced cell viability in both assays to less than or equal to 10% or were scored as active, while compounds which cause less than 90% growth inhibition were scored as inactive. Compounds that reduced cell viability in only one assay to less than or equal to 10% were scored as inconclusive.	Because of the inherent error in all high throughput screens, especially involving single replicate and concentration testing, the compounds that were active were assigned a ranking of 100, while inactive compounds were assigned a rank of 0.	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/572

A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent growth inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % growth inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. Compounds were screened in single dose and there is an inherent uncertainty associated with a single determination.	Because of the inherent error in all high throughput screens, compounds that were active in this single dose screen were assigned a score of 100.

A homogenous, mix-and-measure, fluorescence peptide cleavage assay was proposed as the primary screening assay format. The cDNA fragment of the West Nile and Dengue genome encoding the NS2b-NS3 proteinase were cloned from cDNA fragments provided by Drs. Richard Kinney, CDC, Fort Collins, CO, and Michael Diamond, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. The wild-type NS2b-NS3 proteinase construct was expressed in E. coli and pilot-scale quantities of the homogeneous material were purified by Dr. Strongin and his colleagues at the Burnham Institute. Autolysis of the NS2b-NS3 precursor was used to generate the soluble, mature and homogenous NS3 proteinase. The cleavage assay employs the proteolytic enzyme, purified NS3 proteinase of West Nile virus provided by Dr Strongin of the Burnham Institute, and a commercially available fluorescence substrate Pyr-RTKR-AMC.	Confirmed dose dependent NS2b-NS3 inhibitors will be screened for selectivity against Dengue Virus NS2b-NS3 proteinase (to be provided by Dr. Strongin).  The assay provider will also profile confirmed inhibitors against host serine proteases including; furin, plasmin, urokinase, and trypsin.  The assay provider plans to follow up interesting hits utilizing a variety of methodologies; iterative enzymatic tests, rational structure based design, computer-assisted docking, NMR ligand binding studies, and a variety of cell based assays including compound cytotoxicity evaluations, West Nile Virus subgenomic replicon and reporter gene assays, CytoPathic effect inhibition assays, and reduction in viral titer assays.	screening	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/577
